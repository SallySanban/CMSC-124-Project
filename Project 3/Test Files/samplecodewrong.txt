BTW Declaring variables:
I HAS A MESSAGE ITZ "CATZ ARE GOOD"

OBTW
    (This is a codeblock.) Variables are dynamically typed so you don't need to
    declare their type. A variable's type matches its content. These are the
    types:
TLDR

I HAS A STRING  ITZ "DOGZ ARE GOOOD" BTW type is YARN
I HAS A INTEGER ITZ 42               BTW type is NUMBR
I HAS A FLOAT   ITZ 3.1415           BTW type is NUMBAR
I HAS A BOOLEAN ITZ WIN              BTW type is TROOF
I HAS A UNTYPED                      BTW type is NOOB

BTW Accepting user input:
I HAS A AGE
BTW The variable is stored as a YARN. To convert it into NUMBR:

BTW LOLCODE uses polish notation style math.

BTW Basic mathematical notation:
SUM OF SUM OF 21 AN 33 AN 21         BTW 21 + 33
DIFF OF 90 AN 10        BTW 90 - 10
PRODUKT OF 12 AN 13     BTW 12 * 13
QUOSHUNT OF 32 AN 43    BTW 32 / 43
MOD OF 43 AN 64         BTW 43 modulo 64
BIGGR OF MOD OF 23 AN 53 AN 27      BTW max(23, 53)
SMALLR OF 53 AN 45      BTW min(53, 45)

BTW Binary notation:
BOTH OF WIN AN WIN           BTW and: WIN if x=WIN, y=WIN
EITHER OF FAIL AN WIN        BTW or: FAIL if x=FAIL, y=FAIL
WON OF WIN AN FAIL           BTW xor: FAIL if x=y

BTW Case statement:

I HAS A TEMPERATURE

BTW While loop:

KTHXBYE BTW GOODBYE
